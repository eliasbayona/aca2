## Training your Brain : Memory Techniques

	• “thinking the right way”
	• Let your brain have fun — Be Creative!
	• Make your brain focus on the task by forcing it to make strong connections
	* The most obvious things are weak connections, so use as many senses outrageous ideas
	* Learning are new connections
	* The amount of the brain used in visual processing can be used — so visualize
	
spacing effect: tendency for distributed practice to yield better long-term serial position effect: retention than is achieved through massed study or practice

our tendency to recall best the first and last items in a list

**imagery**: mental pictures; a powerful aid to effortful processing, especially when combined with semantic encoding

**deep processing**: Encoding through meaningful interaction with the content. Often, encoding semantically, based on the meaning of the words; tends to yield the best retention

# Problem Solving Steps
[How a Googler solves coding problems – Noteworthy - The Journal Blog](https://blog.usejournal.com/how-a-googler-solves-coding-problems-ec5d59e73ec5)
### 1) Draw it.
So don’t write code. Don’t even think about code. You’ll have plenty of time to add the semicolons and parentheses later. Just try to figure out how you, as a human computer, solve the problem.
### 2) Write it in English.
Here, we think about the algorithm I identified in step 1), and try to write it out in English. This makes the steps concrete, so that we can refer back to it later when writing the code.
### 3) Write pseudocode.
Pseudocode isn’t really code, but it mimics the structure of code.
### 4) Translate what you can to code.
Note: For easier problems, this can be combined with the step above.
### 5) Don’t guess.
A common mistake I see in new coders is the practice of finding something on the internet, saying “maybe this will work”, and plugging it into your program without testing it. The more pieces of your program you don’t understand, the less likely you are to end up with the right solution.

## What is your learning style? Nope, it’s Bunk.
[Learning styles & the importance of critical self-reflection | Tesia Marshik | TEDxUWLaCrosse - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=855Now8h5Rs)
	* Learning is conceptual ie. based on **meaning**
	* Which is why highlighting or rereading doesn’t help
	* Chess experts could memorize boards better because of chunking  (chase and simon, 1973) Random boards remove any benefit of memory.
	* The benefit of critical self-reflection and the idea of ‘first principles’. No one challenges things that them

# Learning to Learn
[Learning to Learn | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/learning-to-learn/) _Sarah Drasner_
“Academic background or not, technical education doesn’t stop once you get a job. On the contrary: nothing in tech stays in one place, and **the single most valuable skill you can possess to remain employable over time is learning how to learn**.”

## Do Not Copy-Paste
I also really like this quote from Zed Shaw’s _Learn Python the Hard Way_.
**Do Not Copy-Paste**
> You must type each of these exercises in, manually. If you copy and paste, you might as well just not even do them. The point of these exercises is to train your hands, your brain, and your mind in how to read, write, and see code. If you copy-paste, you are cheating yourself out of the effectiveness of the lessons.  

## Practice!!!
I also love this quote from _Art and Fear_, and bring it up frequently as it's been a guiding light for me:
> The ceramics teacher announced on opening day that he was dividing the class into two groups. All those on the left side of the studio, he said, would be graded solely on the quantity of work they produced, all those on the right solely on its quality.   
> His procedure was simple: on the final day of class he would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of the "quantity" group: fifty pounds of pots rated an "A", forty pounds a "B", and so on. Those being graded on "quality", however, needed to produce only one pot —albeit a perfect one —to get an "A".   
> Well, came grading time and a curious fact emerged: the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity. It seems that while the "quantity" group was busily churning out piles of work—and learning from their mistakes — the "quality" group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay.  

## Deliberate Practice
[Eduardo Briceño: How to get better at the things you care about | TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/eduardo_briceno_how_to_get_better_at_the_things_you_care_about?utm_campaign=tedspread&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=tedcomshare)
Dr. Anders Ericsson
Learning Zone vs Performance Zone
	1. First, we must believe and understand that we can improve, what we call a growth mindset.
	2. Second, we must want to improve at that particular skill. There has to be a purpose we care about, because it takes time and effort.
	3. Third, we must have an idea about how to improve, what we can do to improve, not how I used to practice the guitar as a teenager, performing songs over and over again, but doing deliberate practice.
	4. Fourth, **we must be in a low-stakes situation**, because if mistakes are to be expected, then the consequence of making them must not be catastrophic, or even very significant. A tightrope walker doesn't practice new tricks without a net underneath, and an athlete wouldn't set out to first try a new move during a championship match. 

## Real confidence is about modeling ongoing learning
Instructors must model learning!

## Time 
You need to give time. You can learn anything as long as you have time.

	* Pomodoro Technique: Focused and dispersed modes
	* Sleep
	* Exercise

Working Memory
	* 4 slots
	* Multi-tasking wastes slots when in focused mode

Practice converts Working memory to Long term memory

Chunking creates the ability to store more information in working memory slots
	* Mastery leads to bigger chunks

Sources of Creativity
	* Slow thinkers can find solutions that fast thinkers will miss or overlook 
	* Poor memory or people that are easily distracted can be more creative

Illusions of Competency 
	* 

Tests Tests Tests
Memorize
Homework is practice

Rewrite your code

Don’t cut and paste
Type from memory

## Create Quote Cards of important concepts!
Ability to explain the concept is a reflection of mastery
